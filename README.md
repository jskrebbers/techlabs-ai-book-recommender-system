# AI_SEE what you like - Book predictions based on sentiment analysis

## 1. Project Overview

The project "AI_SEE What You Like" aims to enhance the book recommendation process by developing a model that leverages sentiment analysis of user reviews instead of relying solely on traditional star ratings. This approach is designed to provide more personalized and accurate book recommendations by understanding and interpreting the sentiments expressed in text reviews. The project was part of our participation in the Artificial Intelligence track of Techlabs Düsseldorf's Digital Shaper program in the summer term 2024.

## 2. Usage

All our code is written in Python and can be found in the file `AI_Projekt_24/Code/AI_SEE_Code.ipynb`. We used Google Colab for development and execution. To replicate this setup, we recommend uploading the entire folder structure to Google Drive. The raw data can be found here: [Amazon Books Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews/data). Import them to the "Raw" file otherwise you may need to adjust the paths in the Jupyter notebook accordingly. Due to the file size limitation at Github, larger files are divided into many smaller files. They must first be reassembled at the start of each step in the notebook; a corresponding line of code is created. The XGBoost model has not been uploaded to Github due to the same limitations, but it can be rebuilt using the code and raw data provided at the previous link. Just note that the sentiment analysis takes a very long time with only a CPU (about 4 days). Further documentation is available in the Jupyter notebook itself. Additionally, the project scope can be reviewed in the corresponding file. A detailed blog post about the project will soon be available on Medium.
